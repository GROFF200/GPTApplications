ACME Web Services Overview
ACME operates a multi-tier web service architecture designed to ensure high availability and secure transactions for all our clients. Our primary web servers are hosted on AWS and Azure, providing robust scalability and reliability.
======###
Server Specifications
The main web server, AWS-Web01, runs Apache 2.4 on Ubuntu 20.04, equipped with a load balancer handling incoming traffic to distribute loads evenly across two backend servers. Each server supports HTTP/2 to enhance the speed and efficiency of communications.
======###
Login Procedures
Access to the server backend is secured through SSH keys and all administrative tasks require two-factor authentication. System administrators only have access through a secure VPN, with all activities logged for auditing purposes.
======###
Database Management
Our primary database server, DB01, runs MySQL 8.0 on a dedicated Linux server. Daily backups are automated and stored in a geo-redundant cloud storage solution to prevent data loss in case of physical damage to the data center.
======###
Content Delivery Network (CDN) Usage
ACME utilizes Cloudflare as its CDN to ensure fast content delivery worldwide. The CDN caches static content at edge locations globally, reducing the load on our primary servers and improving user experience.
======###
Security Measures
Regular security audits are performed, with updates to firewalls and intrusion detection systems applied promptly. All web traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.3, and our cybersecurity team monitors for any suspicious activity 24/7.
======###
Server Upgrade Schedule
Quarterly maintenance and upgrades are scheduled for all servers to ensure they remain secure and perform optimally. Upcoming maintenance for server AWS-Web01 is scheduled for the third quarter of 2024, during which we will upgrade the operating system and Apache software.
