This repo contains several utilities I have created that use either local LLMs, or GPT APIs.

1.  GPTConversion - This reads COBOL from a text file and uses llama3 to describe the functionality.  Useful for developers who don't have COBOL experience but need to translate code to other languages.
2.  GPTSpanishTeacher - Uses the GPT API, and some python libraries, so that the user can speak into a microphone, send it to GPT, then hear the response via text-to-speech
3.  GPTStockUtils - A collection of tools that uses GPT, the Yahoo finance API, and the Alpaca Market API to evaluate and monitor stocks.
4.  GPTUtils - Some useful tools that use LLMs
5.  LLMTrainer - Uses unsloth to train llama2.  Requires a lot of memory to run successfully.
6.  LangChainProjects - Applications that use langchain to interact with LLMs.
