This repo contains several utilities I have created that use either local LLMs, or GPT APIs.

1.  GPTConversion - This reads COBOL from a text file and uses llama3 to describe the functionality.  Useful for developers who don't have COBOL experience but need to translate code to other languages.
2.  GPTSpanishTeacher - Uses the GPT API, and some python libraries, so that the user can speak into a microphone, send it to GPT, then hear the response via text-to-speech
3.  GPTUtils - Some useful tools that use LLMs
4.  GPTStockUtils - A collection of tools that uses GPT, the Yahoo finance API, and the Alpaca Market API to evaluate and monitor stocks.
