This repo contains several utilities I have created that use either local LLMs, or GPT APIs.

1.  CustomerSupportRAG - Has utiltiies to build a vector database, and it also allows the user to query that database using llama3 or GPT
2.  GPTConversion - This reads COBOL from a text file and uses llama3 to describe the functionality.  Useful for developers who don't have COBOL experience but need to translate code to other languages.
3.  GPTSpanishTeacher - Uses the GPT API, and some python libraries, so that the user can speak into a microphone, send it to GPT, then hear the response via text-to-speech
4.  GPTStockUtils - A collection of tools that uses GPT, the Yahoo finance API, and the Alpaca Market API to evaluate and monitor stocks.
5.  GPTUtils - Some useful tools that use LLMs
6.  LLMTrainer - Uses unsloth to train llama2.  Requires a lot of memory to run successfully.
7.  LangChainProjects - Applications that use langchain to interact with LLMs.
